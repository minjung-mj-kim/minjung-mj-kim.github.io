By default, you can't display math equations in Latex style with Minimal Mistakes theme, but you can using MathJax.
I found the very simple instruction about how to use MathJax from its website.
[MathJax website](https://www.mathjax.org/#gettingstarted)
Just follow two steps in the below.


# 1. Add a snippet

Add the following codes at the end of your "\_includes/scripts.html" file in your minimal mistakes theme folder.

```
<script src="https://polyfill.io/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=es6"></script>
<script id="MathJax-script" async src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js"></script>
```



# 2. Write a math equation on your post

On your markdown file, write a math equation between the two \$\$s.

```
$$f(x)=\frac{2}{\sqrt{x}}$$
```
Then you will get the following.

$$f(x)=\frac{2}{\sqrt{x}}$$
