# Intro
To celebrate BTS's new anthology album, 
I transfered their all of previous styles to the new album's concept photo.

This is a short, quick, and fun neural style transfer project.
I didn't play with fine tunings because my computer is slow...

The more texture the source style has, the more interesting output is generated.
To improve the output, photos with clear texture/pattern input will help.

Unlike the other project, I'm not showing my source code just in case it is used too much (Probably I don't have to be worried about it. This blog doesn't have any visitor...).


## Data source:
- [Bighit blog](https://ibighit.com/bts/)
- [Official facebook](https://www.facebook.com/bangtan.official/photos_albums)
- MV captures

I tested quite a lot of images to generate the best outcome.
