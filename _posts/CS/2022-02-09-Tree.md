A tree is a data structure that represents a hierarchical relationship. 
A link to another node is one way (only from higher to lower, no cyclic connection), 
and each node has its own subtree.

# Component
- Node: an element of a tree (data + link to its child node(s))
    - Root node: The top node of a tree
    - Parent node (higher) <-> Child node (lower)
    - Sibling nodes: Nodes that have the same parent nodes. 
    - Ancestor node: A parent or higher node
    - Descendent node: A child or lower node
    - Terminal node (=leaf): A node that doesn't have a child node
    - Internal node: A node that is not a terminal node
- Edge: a line connects two adjacent nodes

# Terms
- Level: Depth from the root (level of the root = 1)
- Height (=depth of a tree): The maximum level of a tree
- Degree of a node: Its number of child node(s)
- Degree of a tree: The maximum degree of a node within a tree

# Binary tree
A tree whose degree is two or smaller is a binary tree. 
In a binary tree, every internal node has either one or two children. 
Every subtree of a binary tree is another binary tree.

## N-degree tree can be a binary tree
Every n-degree tree can be transformed into a binary tree by following steps.
1. Remove all edges except the connection between a parent and the most left child.
2. From every node, draw an edge to its sibling at the right. 
3. Rotate the tree 90 degrees clockwise.

## Variations
- Complete binary tree: All internal nodes have two children nodes
- Perfect/Full binary tree: All level is full (l-th level has 2^l nodes). A perfect binary tree is a complete binary, but not vice versa. 
- Skewed binary tree: Every node has either one or zero child.


# Traverse

## Breadth First Search (BFS)
- Level order traversal: Start from the root, scan all nodes in a level, then move to the next level, and iterate this process.
- Implementation: Queue (children should wait until all of their parent and its sibling(s) is popped out, see the code below)

## Depth First Search (DFS)
- Traverse until meeting a leaf, then go back to the previous node, then traverse to another direction, and iterate this process.
- Variation
    - Pre-order traversal: Self->Left child->Right child
    - In-order traversal: Left child->Self->Right child
    - Post-order traversal: Left child->Right child->Self
- Implementation: Recursive algorithm (see the code below) or Stack (The deeper the node, the closer to the top in a stack. Then once the deepest node is searched, it is popped out.)

# Implementation
Binary tree implementation can be done using a linked list with two pointers, 
for its left child and right child.

This representation matches the intuitive image of a tree with its node connections.
Array can be used as well, however, not efficient in memory usage except for full trees.

```

            self.data = data

        if root_node==None:

        q = deque()

        # first, add root
        q.append(root_node)

            self.traverse_pre(root_node.right)
        else:
            return

            self.traverse_in(root_node.right)
        else:
            return
            

    def traverse_post(self,root_node):

        if root_node:
            self.traverse_post(root_node.left)
            self.traverse_post(root_node.right)
            print('Postorder - node:',root_node.data)
        else:
            return
