A heap is a complete binary tree, 
where every parent has a key greater than or equal to (max heap) or less than or equal to (min heap) its child's key. 

# Properties
- Height of a heap with n nodes: log2(n)+1
- Except for the last level, i-th level has 2^(i-1) nodes.
- Left child's index = parent's index * 2  
- Right child's index = parent's index * 2 + 1
- Parent's index = Child's index/2

# Insertion (upheap)
1. Insert the new element next to the last node
2. Keep exchanging with its parent until it satisfies max/min heap condition

Time complexity: height of a heap, O(log2(n)) 

# Deletion (downheap)
1. Move the last element to the deleted node
2. Keep exchanging with its larger (smaller) child until it satisfies max (min) heap condition

Time complexity: height of a heap, O(log2(n)) 

# Heap sort
Sorting algorithm which utilize heap structure.
For n elements,
1. Add elements with upheap 
2. Delete and pop element with downheap. Popped element is saved to the sorted array

Time complexity: For each element, maximum number of upheap or downheap operation is equal to the tree height, O(log2(n))
Total complexity for n elements: O(nlog2(n))

# Implementation
Array can represent heap elements.
```
