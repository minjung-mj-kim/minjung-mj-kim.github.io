Here, I'm presenting my code I used to clean text data for my [fake news detection project](https://minjung-mj-kim.github.io/projects-fn/fakenews/).
I hope it is useful!

```python
# To test
exp_list = []
```

# First handling itmes
- Items requiring irregular treatment.
- Process least interfering cleaning item first.



### Replace N. Korea, N.Korea to North Korea
- This word occurs frequently, so its expression better be unified.
- Do this step before removing single words.


```python
# Replace N. Korea, N.Korea to North Korea
old_exp = '(?:[\s]|^)[N][\.]?[\s]?Korea'
new_exp = ' North Korea'
replace_regex(old_exp, new_exp, verbose=False)
exp_list.append(old_exp)
```

###  Remove single letter capical word
- Usually middle names, which is not necessary.
- Remove such words after treat N. Korea stuffs.


```python
# Remove single letter capical word (e.g. middle name)
old_exp = '(?:[\s]|^)[A-Z][\.](?:[\s]|$)'
new_exp = ' '
replace_regex(old_exp, new_exp, verbose=False)
exp_list.append(old_exp)
```

###  Abbreviation before PoS tagging
- Unify different abbreviation for a same word.
- Do this step before removing dots.
- Abbreviation items:
    - Remove a dot at the end of a Month word starts with an upper case. (Jul. -> Jul)
    - No. \<number\> to \_number_
    - UN, UK variations : U.N. and U.K. then \_u_n_ and \_u_k_ after PoS tagging
    - Rep. : Rep
    - Sept. : Sep
    - Sen. : Sen
    - Gov. : Gov
    - PM : PM, then \_prime_minister_ after PoS tagging 
    - P.M. and p.m. (post meridiem): p.m., then \_pm_ after PoS tagging (same for a.m.)
    - US, U.S, U.S. or U.S.A.: U.S., then \_u_s_ after PoS tagging

# Special characters, before word tokenization

# Word tokenization and Part-of-Speech (PoS) taggins

### Tokenize and PoS tagging
Use TreebankWordTokenizer

### Abbreviation with dot
- Some abbreviations contained dots for proper PoS taggings
- Now, remove dots in the abbreviations

### Stopword and short word removal 
- Remove stop words
- Remove 1-2 letters words


```python
def convert_pos(pos):
    
    tag = ''
    try:
        # get first two letters of PoS tag

    if tag == 'JJ':
        tag = 'a'

    elif tag == 'RB':
