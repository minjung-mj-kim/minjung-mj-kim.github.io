*Merge revenue, wage, and census data to analyze dancer's revenue prediction*


I'm looking for the best Metropolitan area in the U.S. where I can be a belly dancer. 
I'd like to either be employed or open a studio.
The problem is that it is impossible to predict the potential income of a belly dancer in each area due to lack or absent of such data. 


The goal is to pick a Metropolitan area where I can expect the most profit as a dancer, 
i.e. I need **reveneu per area** data.
However, datasets which include per area information don't have revenue data.
On the other hand, revenue data is not available for per area.


The best thing I can do is to make a hypothesis to build a connection between those two kinds of data.
To do that, first, I collected various data and then cleaned and combined multiple dataset into one dataframe.
**[Check out my Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/minjung-mj-kim/project/blob/master/dance_studio/merge_dataset.ipynb) 
to see how I did so.**
