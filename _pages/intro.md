This blog will cover essential data science topics which are necessary to complete a machine learning project and introduce my personal projects. The content of each category is explained below.

## Data collection

You can download enormously various prepared datasets from many **open sources**. If you want to get custumized data, you can consider to conduct a **survey,** perform **web scrapping**, or use a **company**. In case your data samples are lack of statistics, there are clever **data augmentation** techniques for certain cases.

This category will cover examples of data collection and generation including topics highlighed with bold text.

## Pre-modeling

Collected raw data should be processed for better performance of your machine learning. This process includes **noise removal** and **data wrangling**. For various numerical features, **standardization/normalization** of data is required to match scale between different features.

In case of text data, there are special preprocessing procedures such as **tokenization** and **stemming**. Then **encoding**, convert a word to a vector, is applied. For image data, there are python libraries which can **decode an image file** into a 3 dimensional array, where its values correspond to pixel brightness of three (RGB) or one (gray scale) colors.

Once the data are organized, **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** will bring some insight of your data through **visualization** and **statistical** **analysis**. For highly correlated feature variables, you can decide to drop such features for simplicity and efficiency in modeling. After this step, in case of dealing with high demension data while sacrificing interpretability is allowed, one can apply **principal component analysis (PCA)** to reduce demension of features.

This category will cover necessary handworks before feed data into a machine learning process including topics highlighed with bold text.

## Machine learning

Now you have well prepared data as input of your machine learning model. There are **various machine learning models**, from simple linear regression model to **neural network variations** (e.g. CNN, RNN, LSTM) and **decision tree models** (e.g. Random forest, Gradient boost). For any model, **learning process** includes choice of **metric**, **optimization** algorithm and **regularization** techniques, **hyperparameter tuning**, and **evaluation and** **improvement** of the model. In addition, there are useful learning **techniques/methods** such as **transfer learning** and **ensemble learning**.

This category will cover introduction of various machine learning models, model specific topics, training/test/improvement process and tips, and machine learning glossary including topics highlighed with bold text.
